    Angular is one of the most popular frameworks in the world for building not
    only web applications but even mobile and desktop applications as well.
    Backed by Google and used by Google, this framework is used by millions of
    applications. Although the framework is well-suited for applications of any
    scale, enterprises particularly favor Angular due to its opinionated nature
    and its consistent ecosystem, which includes all the tools necessary for
    creating modern &amp; production-ready web applications. While learning the
    core technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is an absolute essential
    to progress as a web developer, when it comes to a framework, learning the
    core concepts of the framework itself is important too. When we’re dealing
    with Angular, there are a lot of amazing things we can do with our web
    applications by learning about, and using, the right tools in the Angular
    ecosystem. That’s where this book comes in. This book was written for
    intermediate and advanced Angular developers to polish their Angular
    development skills with recipes that you can follow easily, play around
    with, and practice your own variations of. You’ll not only learn from the
    recipes themselves but also from the actual real-life projects associated
    with the recipes. So, there are a lot of hidden gems in these recipes and
    projects for you. Happy coding!
